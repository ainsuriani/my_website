            My name is <strong>Nur Ain Suriani binti Sarizam</strong>, and I am from Port Dickson,
            Negeri Sembilan. Currently, I am pursuing a <i> Diploma in Information Management </i> at 
            <em> UiTM Rembau</em>. Being the only one in my family to continue education at the university 
            level,my goal is simple but meaningful: <b>I want to make my parents proud of me for the hard 
            work I am putting into my studies.</b>
        <p>
            I would describe myself as an ambivert; I adapt to my surroundings, sometimes enjoying quiet 
            moments alone and,other times, joining friends for group activities. In my free time, I like 
            to relax by taking a nap or going for a walk.These moments help me recharge, providing a balance
            between my need for solitude and my desire to connect with others.

            I come from a family of five siblings, with one brother and three sisters. While my family is
            incredibly supportive,my educational journey has been somewhat unique.With no family members
            who attended university before me,I rely on my friends and lecturers for guidance on how to 
            navigate university life. This independence is both a challenge and a source of strength, pushing 
            me to find my own way while knowing that I am setting an example for my younger siblings.
        </p>

        <p> 
            My early school years were filled with excitement and active participation. In primary school, 
            I eagerly joined academic and extracurricular competitions, finding joy and fulfillment in every 
            challenge. However, this enthusiasm dimmed when I moved to a secondary religious school, where I 
            felt too shy to participate as actively as before. By the time I turned 16, I made the choice to
            switch to a regular secondary school, a decision that brought back the joy of active involvement 
            and allowed me to rediscover my confidence.
